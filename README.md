## Abstract

Myofascial pain accounts for large portions of chronic pain reports. Buddhist meditators report tension and thermal changes during meditation. It's postulated that myofascial release can be accomplished through Buddhist meditation via localised vascular dilation mediated by local nitric oxide abundance due to attentional and respiratory coupling that occurs in breathing-oriented meditation.


## Introduction

Myofascial pain accounts for large portions of chronic pain reports. A myofascial trigger point (MTrP) is classically defined as "a hyperirritable spot in skeletal muscle that is associated with a hypersensitive palpable nodule in a taut band" (Simons 1999) and is commonly recognized as "muscle knots" (Kao, 2007). Biochemicals local to active MTrPs were found to have a lower pH (Shah 2008). Acidic pH levels within muscle have been shown to be associated with pain (Issberner 1996). The receptor proteins hypothesised to be involved in this nociception (Shah 2008) are also involved in thermoception ().

A variety of therapeutic methods have been studied for managing and treating MTrPs which involve external intervention such as with electrical, chemical or dry-needling modalities. Physical rehabilitation therapies involving massage, stretching and strengthening are also well established. 

In a study of meditation-related challenges faced by Western Buddhists, a third of the participants reported "pressure, tension or release of pressure, tension" and a third of participants also reported "thermal changes" (Lindahl 2007). 

Here we explore how Buddhist meditation may affect MTrPs.

## Method

Subject is male, 30's, light smoker, Buddhist meditator of three years with five years of dabbling preceding. Bilateral subscapularis trigger points reported. Following a full day of activity on a keyboard with unchecked ergonimics, pain level of trigger point palpation noted along with muscle test preceding a 90-minute meditation followed by pain level noting and muscle test.

## Results

Decreased pain levels, increased external rotation prior to nociception after meditation. Slight increase in nociception followed by acute localised coolness accompanied by tingling during meditation.

## Discussion

Buddhism is a religion centred around the elimination of pain (dukkha). A core doctrine for salvation in Buddhism is found in The Seven Factors of Awakening (satta-bojjhanga) which lists Refreshment (piti) and Relaxation (passaddhi) as the fourth and fifth of seven sequentally causative factors. Burning (parilaha) is listed as what is counter to and eliminated in producing Refreshment with Dysfunction (dutthulla) listed for that of Relaxation. 

In the Integrated Trigger Point Hypothesis, a chronic excess of the neurotransmitter responsible for muscle contraction keeps the muscle fiber from relaxing. The chronic contraction of the fiber precipitates a chronic starving of the capillaries supplying the region which circularly prevents the clearance of the neurotransmitter excess (Davies 2013).

It's postulated that localised vascular dilation mediated by nitric oxide increase () mediated by locus coeruleus and respiratory coupling () is involved in the results above. The acute decrease in local blood pressure coupled with the normalization of pH may be responsible for the acute, local perception of coolness.

Some consider nitric oxide as the biomolecular manifestation of prana. Nitric oxide has also been cited as a potential cancer-promoting or anti-cancer agent. Possibly, excess focus on a tumor may initiate or exacerbate metastasis.
