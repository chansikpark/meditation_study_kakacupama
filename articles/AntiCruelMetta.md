# Anti-Cruel Mettā

The [Paṭisambhidāmagga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa%E1%B9%ADisambhid%C4%81magga) is a book of the Khuddaka Nikāya and is considered to be a part of a later strata of the Pali Canon. Notwithstanding whatever text-critical issues stemming from this lateness, the handful of illuminating gems punctuating its reams of tabular repetition have been a joy to stumble upon, certainly worth the trouble of parsing the small portion I've managed to thus far. One such gem can be found in the [Mettākathā](https://suttacentral.net/ps2.4/), one of the thirty or so 'chapters' of the book.

It concerns a ubiquitous and staple practice for Buddhists, the cultivation of that which is variously translated into English as 'loving-kindness', 'goodwill', 'loving-friendliness', or 'love'. A typical prescription for practice involves first bringing to mind some person for whom the emotion being cultivated is easy to invoke, and then steadily attempting to maintain this emotion towards those for whom it is difficult. While the formulation of the practice in the earliest texts is [markedly different](https://suttacentral.net/dn13/en/sujato#dn13:76.1)—emphasizing directionality and emotional variety (ie. the three other Brahmaviharas)—I presume that there is some kind of post-canonical commentarial basis or even some practical reason for the ubiquity of this meditation method.

What I find most valuable about the Mettākathā is that we find in its core prescription a clear definition of the mental quality being cultivated. Whereas a workable illustration of the meaning of mettā can certainly be drawn from the variety of contexts to be found in the earliest Pali texts, the Mettākathā presents us with a compact and thorough definition of mettā that, drawing forth its anti-cruel dimensions, may be more wont to inspire altruistic uplift when invoked in the conventional method.

The only English translation I'm aware of is granted to us by the prolificity of the late [Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%91%C4%81%E1%B9%87amoli_Bhikkhu). The excerpt goes like this:

> It is lovingkindness (mettā) since it treats kindly (mettayati) in these eight aspects, namely: 
> 1. by rejecting in the case of all beings their oppression for their non-oppression, 
> 2. by rejecting their injury for their non-injury, 
> 3. by rejecting their disappointment for their non-disappointment,
> 4. by rejecting their deprivation for their non-deprivation, 
> 5. by rejecting their harrassment for their non-harrassment 
>
> [with the thought] 'Let all beings be
>
> 6. free from enmity and not inimical, 
> 7. have pleasure and not pain, 
> 8. have bliss in their hearts and not pain in their hearts'. 

By the first five aspects, we reject ([vijjeti](https://suttacentral.net/define/vajjati)) victimizing in the form of oppression ([pīḷana](https://suttacentral.net/define/pīḷana)), injury ([upaghāta](https://suttacentral.net/define/upaghāta)), disappointment ([santāpa](https://suttacentral.net/define/santāpa); torment), deprivation ([pariyādāna](https://suttacentral.net/define/pariyādāna)), and harrassment ([vihesa](https://suttacentral.net/define/vihesā)). There is surely no lack of victims to be found in the world. Bring them to mind. Be on their side. With the final three aspects, a universal attitude is cultivated—one by which one can ever hope that even the most hateful might find reform.
