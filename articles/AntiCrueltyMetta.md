# Anti-Cruelty Mettā

The [Paṭisambhidāmagga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pa%E1%B9%ADisambhid%C4%81magga), a book of the Khuddaka Nikāya, is considered to be part of a later strata of the Pali Canon. Nonetheless, the occasional gems punctuating its reams of tabular repetition have been a joy to stumble upon, certainly worth the trouble of parsing the small portion I've managed thus far. One such gem can be found in the [Mettākathā](https://suttacentral.net/ps2.4/), one of the thirty or so 'chapters' of the book.

It concerns a ubiquitous and staple practice for Buddhists, the cultivation of that which is variously translated into English as 'loving-kindness', 'goodwill', 'loving-friendliness', or 'love'. A typical prescription for practice involves first bringing to mind some person for whom the emotion being cultivated is easy to invoke, and then steadily attempting to maintain this emotion towards those for whom it is difficult. While the formulation of the practice in the earliest texts is [markedly different](https://suttacentral.net/dn13/en/sujato#dn13:76.1)—emphasizing directionality and emotional variety (ie. the three other Brahmaviharas)—I presume that there is some kind of post-canonical commentarial basis or even some practical reason for the ubiquity of this meditation method.

What I find most valuable about the Mettākathā is that its core prescription is an explicit definition of the mental quality being cultivated. Whereas a nuanced meaning of mettā can certainly be drawn from the variety of occurrences in the earliest Pali texts, the Mettākathā presents a compact definition that, drawing forth dimensions of anti-cruelty, imparts a potency to the practice that may be easy to neglect.

The only English translation I'm aware of is granted by the prolificity of the late [Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%91%C4%81%E1%B9%87amoli_Bhikkhu). The excerpt goes like this:

> It is lovingkindness (mettā) since it treats kindly (mettayati) in these eight aspects, namely: 
> 1. by rejecting in the case of all beings their oppression for their non-oppression, 
> 2. by rejecting their injury for their non-injury, 
> 3. by rejecting their disappointment for their non-disappointment,
> 4. by rejecting their deprivation for their non-deprivation, 
> 5. by rejecting their harrassment for their non-harrassment 
>
> [with the thought] 'Let all beings
>
> 6. be free from enmity and not inimical, 
> 7. have pleasure and not pain, 
> 8. have bliss in their hearts and not pain in their hearts'. 

TODO draw out some linguistic features (eg. semantics, how the five relates to the three via grammar, maybe even analysis of the entire text)
