Today, over 4000 deaths were reported in the US due to COVID-19.

Is there anything I can be doing right now to help?

One low-hanging fruit may be to compose some kind of brass tacks meditation manual, dotted with strong hints of COVID-19 applicability. However, this runs the risk of doing more harm than good in the absence of any empirical veridity, which is as it stands from where I am currently. Any kind of human trial that might be designed to produce evidence of efficacy would not, at a glance, be possible to do in an ethical way, given that vaccines are already on the way.

Another approach, avoiding any kind of intentional infection or risking such, would be to address the post-COVID-19 long-hauler, find efficacy for some meditation protocol there. But here again, this is an avenue rife with risks. I think I would ideally like to begin by documenting the progression of meditation skill acquisition of a healthy person capable of unencumbered consent, while measuring various things that are proven to be helpful against COVID-19. 

Even in this situation, a well-defined meditation protocol would be involved. And so, I think I'll see about coming up with some prescriptive scheme.
