An initial pass at a curriculum gradation; just off the top of my head.

#### Basic anatomy.
	- Some riveting subset of A&P introductories
	
#### Settling in
	- Anatomy lesson: vertebrae
	- Find a handful of comfortable postures; standing, sitting, lying down
		- Kyphosis; lordosis
	- Be ok with just breathing for a while
  - Intro to focal, locative, and null frames
  
#### Proprioception
	- Anatomy lesson: Respiratory & attentional coupling; proprioception amplification
	- Lateral walls of nose bridge, until there is tension or some conjurable sensation (maybe even use q-tips to gently locate)

#### Integumentary
	- Anatomy lesson: Nervous system, dermatomes
	- Segment-by-segment skin proprioception
		- locative fashioning (tracing, visualization, triangulation, connect-the-dots)
		- focal fashioning - loosen/weaken attention and gradually strengthen as possible	

#### Full breathing
	- Anatomy lesson: Gross anatomy of the respiratory tract
	- Physiology lesson: Tingling
	(cerebral perfusion...turning on the faucet)
	parimukhaá¹ƒ: full-throated; cranial innervations; respiratory tract
	- Scope out the entire respiratory tract with some light locative, then switch to focal 
	
#### More anatomy and physiology...


(speculative measurables...?)
