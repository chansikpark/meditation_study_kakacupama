In light of continuing revelations of engineering catastrophes by various apparently over-funded entities, it would seem incumbent on me in such a climate of depleting caution to ensure that any serious consideration of risks and corresponding precautions be performed in a maximally secured environment.

Unfortunately, this is not feasible without external involvement (eg. a $3000-$5000 CAD cash injection, or a trustworthy IT security consultation).

The most that seems reasonable to do barring such is to provide some minor clarifications to prior thoughts.
