In light of continuing revelations of engineering catastrophes by various apparently over-funded entities, it would seem incumbent on me to ensure that any serious consideration of risks and corresponding precautions be performed in a maximally secured environment as a best effort at an abundance of caution.

Unfortunately, this is not feasible without external involvement (eg. a $3000-$5000 CAD cash injection, or some credible invitation with which funding may be secured, or a trustworthy InTSec consultation).

The most that seems reasonable to do barring such is to provide some minor clarifications to prior thoughts.
